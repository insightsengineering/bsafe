# **Introduction**

B-SAFE is an R-Shiny app. The app is an innovate software tool for
statistical analysis of adverse event summary data. The app can enhance
the descriptive analysis for a current trial with historical information
on one or more treatment arms for increased precision. It features a
Bayesian Meta-Analytic Predictive (MAP) Prior approach
@neuenschwander_summarizing_2010 and a robust extension
@schmidli_robust_2014, which incorporates historical information for
safety analyses on adverse events into safety analyses for a new trial.
The use of historical information has been used for efficacy analyses in
the past and now being extended to safety analyses.

This user manual details how to use the app. The user manual documents
and specifies the input parameters with their expected outputs. Refer to
the Statistical Analysis Plan for the methodology used.

# **Using the App**

This section introduces the user to the app and how to prepare the
dataset for analysis. From this section on, we will use a simple example to demonstrate the usage of the entire application.

## **Getting Started**

<!-- Path: ../bsafe_manual_pics_online/ -->

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/getting_started.png}
\end{figure}

The **Getting Started** page is the first page you'll encounter on
opening the app. It is expected that users move from left to right along the tabs at the top of the page. Each of the tabs will be explained in detail in the following sections. It provides an overview of the usage of the app. The
app has two main uses:

-   A deep dive into a Bayesian MAP Prior analysis of a selected adverse
    endpoint
-   A Posterior Probability analysis to compare a set of adverse events
    between two treatment arms

Analyses for Incidence Proportions and Exposure-Adjusted Adverse
Event Rates (i.e., Incidence Rates) are available.

To begin any form of analysis, one must upload a dataset (see Section 2.2) that contains
both the adverse events from historical data and the new trial data as a
.csv file. A single dataset is uploaded that contains all relevant
information.

You can then jump directly to the "Download Results" tab for a summary
table with the default. Further analysis into specific Adverse Events
(AEs) can be done if that is needed.

## **Upload Data - Data Preparation**

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/uploading_data.png}
\end{figure}

The "Upload Data" tab makes provision for you to upload the data that
will be used for your analysis.

### Upload CSV File

Click on the Browse button in Figure \ref{fig:fig1} to upload a .csv
file containing the collection of various studies you will use for the
analysis. The data applicable for the MAP Prior analysis is then
displayed on the right hand side of the page.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/upload_data.png}
\caption{Browse File}
\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/upload_data_2.png}
\caption{Data}
\end{figure}

The dataset that is uploaded must include the variable columns shown in Table \ref{table1} to effectively run the analysis:

```{=tex}
\begin{table}[!ht]
\caption{Variable Columns}
  \begin{tabular}{|p{2.5cm}|p{2.7cm}|p{10cm}|}
  \hline
   Variable & Data Type & Description \\
    \hline
    STUDYID & character/numeric  & Study number or name \\
    \hline
    HIST & boolean & 0 for current trial and 1 for historical trial\\
    \hline
    ARM & character/numeric & Defines the various treatment arms in the respective study \\
    \hline
    N & numeric & Total number of patients in the respective study \\
    \hline
    $N \_ WITH\_ AE$ & numeric & Total number of patients for the respective study safety topic who experienced at least one adverse event\\
    \hline
    $SAF \_ TOPIC$  & character & Describes the type of adverse event. Safety topic will be read in by your dataset, max 30 characters\\
    \hline
    TOT \_ EXP & numeric & Total exposure time for the respective safety topic: sum of patients treatment exposure period until occurrence of first event. If no event occurs, use complete observation time\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{table1}
    \end{table}
```
Note that *TOT_EXP* (total exposure time) is only needed for analysis of the
Exposure Adjusted Incidence Rate.

Additionally, other variables including Dose, Freq (Frequency), Length
(Length of treatment), Treat (Treatment) can be included, as shown in Table
\ref{table2}. With these additional variables, subgroup analysis can be
done. Note that in Table \ref{table2}, for variables Freq and Length, the unit does not have to be "day". The time scale depends on the input and should be consistent throughout the entire dataset.

```{=tex}
\begin{table}[!ht]
\caption{Additional Variables}
  \begin{tabular}{|p{2.5cm}|p{2.7cm}|p{10cm}|}
  \hline
   Variable & Data Type & Description \\
   \hline
   Dose & numeric & Amount/weight of the medication the patient took\\
   \hline
   Freq(Frequency) & integer & Number of times in a day the medication was taken by the patient\\
   \hline
   Length & integer & Total number of days the patient was on the treatment \\
   \hline
   Treat & character & The specific treatment the patient was on\\
   \hline
       \end{tabular}
      \label{table2}
    \end{table}
```

The following simple example was manually generated for this introductory example. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/simple_example.png}
\caption{Simple Example}
\label{fig:fig28}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:fig28} displays the example data. In this
dataset, three historical trials will be used to generate the MAP prior
for placebo arm.

### Creation of New Arm

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/add_arm.png}
\caption{Add Arm}
\label{fig:fig2}
\end{figure}

Upon uploading the csv file, the user can create a new arm (which will be used to form the MAP Prior) as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:fig2}. Various variable columns
can be selected for consideration in the creation of the arm. On
creating the new arm, it is added to the dataset and displayed on the
right hand side of the page. This newly created arm can create sub-groups
for which comparisons and sub-group analysis can be done.

In the example, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig29}, only historical
summary data was selected for deriving the MAP prior and we named it as
"hist".

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}
\centering
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/hist.png}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}
\centering
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/hist_2.png}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Select Historical Summary Data}
\label{fig:fig29}
\end{figure}

The filtered data "hist" is then being selected for the "Select patients
with the respective treatment" option.

### Select Patients with the Respective Treatment

If there are different treatment options in the uploaded dataset file,
one can choose a specific treatment from the drop-down menu in Figure
\ref{fig:fig3}. The filtered data is then displayed on the right hand
side of the screen.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/select_treatment.png}
\caption{Treatment Selection}
\label{fig:fig3}
\end{figure}

### Select Safety Analysis

The drop-down menu in Figure \ref{fig:fig4} provides two analyses
options to choose from:

-   Incidence Proportion: sometimes known as Adverse Event Rate which
    describes the proportion of patients with at least one of the
    Adverse Event of interest in our trial, i.e.,
    $Incidence \ Proportion = \frac{\sum{N \_WITH \_ AE}}{\sum N}$ where
    $\sum{N \_WITH \_ AE}$ = total number of patients with AE and
    ${\sum N}$ = total number of patients.

    Incidence proportion can also be described as the estimated
    probability of a patient having one or more AEs during the specific
    period.

-   Exposure Adjusted Event Rate: sometimes referred to as Incident
    rate, which describes the incident rate of AEs per patient per unit
    time assuming a constant hazard rate. This could be interpreted as
    the number of patients having one or more adverse events per unit
    time under assumption of constant risk over the observational
    period.
    $Exposure \ Adjusted\  Event \ Rate = \frac{\sum{N \_ WITH \_AE}}{\sum{t_{i}}}$
    where $\sum{N \_ WITH \_AE}$ = number of subjects who had at least
    one AE, $t_{i}$ = subject $i$'s total exposure time to first AE or
    censoring.
    
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/select_safety_analysis.png}
\caption{Safety Analysis}
\label{fig:fig4}
\end{figure}

The choice of Safety Analysis option is based on the need of the user.

The selection of the Safety Analysis option does not affect the filtered
data that is displayed.

### Select Safety Topic

The user should select a safety topic (AE endpoint) that a (robust) MAP
Prior will explore from the drop-down menu in Figure \ref{fig:fig5}. The
filtered data will be displayed on the right hand side of the screen.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/select_safety_topic.png}
\caption{Safety Topic}
\label{fig:fig5}
\end{figure}

By default, the first AE endpoint (ordered alphabetically) will be
selected and used for analysis.

### Used Seed

The user can manually set the seed for reproducibility of results of the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (see Figure \ref{fig:fig6}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/us.png}
\caption{Used Seed}
\label{fig:fig6}
\end{figure}

### Pool by Study

If the defined treatment arm includes subsets within the trial, e.g.,
several different doses, the user can choose to pool these together or
keep them separated for the purpose of MAP Prior analysis. The default
option is to pool the studies together (see Figure \ref{fig:fig7}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/pool_study.png}
\caption{Pool Study}
\label{fig:fig7}
\end{figure}

For the simple example, suppose here our target is to
estimate the probability of a patient having at least one of the AE of
interest in our trial. Therefore, we select "Incidence Proportion" for
the "Safety Analysis" option. By default, the first AE endpoint DILI (by
alphabetic order) will be selected and used for analysis. Seed number
123456 was used for reproducibility of the results.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/toy_select_analysis.png}
\caption{Select Safety Analysis}
\label{fig:fig30}
\end{figure}

\newpage

# **MAP Prior**

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/map_prior.png}
\end{figure}

The MAP Prior as proposed in @neuenschwander_summarizing_2010 is
estimated using a meta-analytic predictive model which accounts for the
between-trial heterogeneity leading to discounting of the historical
information.

The B-SAFE app uses the Half-normal distribution as a prior distribution for the between trial heterogeneity parameter $\tau$ as seen in
Figure \ref{fig:fig8} which is a special case of the normal distribution
that is truncated to values greater than or equal to zero.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/map_distribution.png}
\caption{Between-Trial Heterogeneity}
\label{fig:fig8}
\end{figure}

To control the amount of information borrowed, the drop-down menu in
Figure \ref{fig:fig9} gives the user control of how much historical
information to borrow using the recommendation in @weber_applying_2021
as shown in Table \ref{tab:table3}. The amount of information to be borrowed depends
on the confidence the user has on the similarity between the new and historical data. In the app, the (default) hyperparameter for $\tau$ representing between-trial heterogeneity has been set to 'large'
@ghadessi_roadmap_2020. Therefore, the amount of historical information borrowed is 'small'.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/map_historical_borrowing.png}
\caption{Amount of Historical Information Borrowed}
\label{fig:fig9}
\end{figure}

```{=tex}
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
        Heterogeneity & $\tau /\sigma$ \\
    \hline
         small & 0.0625 \\
    \hline
        moderate & 0.125 \\
    \hline 
         substantial & 0.25 \\
    \hline
         large & 0.5 \\
    \hline
         very large & 1 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Amount of Historical Borrowing}
    \label{tab:table3}
\end{table}
```

For the Expected Sample Size method, the Expected Local Information
Ratio proposed in @neuenschwander_predictively_2020 is used . This is
due to its predictive consistency, i.e., the posterior expected sample
size on average, if the data are generated from the prior, equals the
sum of the prior expected sample size and the current trial sample
size. The expected sample size calculated from the MAP Prior is rounded
down.

On the top-right corner of Figure \ref{fig:fig10}, is the Model Estimate of which a forest plot
displays the frequentist estimates for the strata (dashed lines) and the
lower part shows the mean distribution and the MAP prior of the mean.

On the bottom-right corner of Figure \ref{fig:fig10}, a density curve and summary statistics is
obtained for the MAP Prior.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/map_effective_sample_size - Copy.png}
\caption{Effective Sample Size}
\label{fig:fig10}
\end{figure}

Should the type of analysis be changed, the update button should be
pressed. If not, the beta values for the previous analysis will be used
leading to wrong estimated values for the mean, standard deviation,
median, 95% credible interval and effective sample size.

One thing to note is that when no historical information is available, a noninformative prior derived from the current data will be used. On the contrary, if there is no current data, the MAP prior will be used.

## **Incidence Proportion**

The mean distribution in Figure \ref{fig:fig11} is the meta-analysis of the incidence proportion
of the various historical data. The MAP Prior distribution is the
predicted true incidence proportion of the population in the new trial
based on the historical data.

The MAP prior for the incidence Proportion is generated by MCMC samples and then approximated by mixture of three
Beta distributions.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/mapip.png}
\caption{Model Estimates and MAP Prior for Incidence Proportion Analysis}
\label{fig:fig11}
\end{figure}

## **Exposure-Adjusted Adverse Event Rate**

Exposure-Adjusted Event Rate is estimated as the log hazard rate using
the asymptotic normal distribution. The MAP Prior for the log hazard is
approximated by mixture of three normal distributions (see Figure \ref{fig:fig12}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/mapea.png}
\caption{MAP Prior for Exposure-Adjusted Adverse Event Rate}
\label{fig:fig12}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:fig12} the variable mean exp, SD exp, Median exp and 95% CrI exp refers to the
mean, standard deviation, median and the 95% Credible Interval of the
MAP Prior on the hazard rate scale.

By default, the between trial heterogeneity was set to "Large" so that the amount of information borrowed would be "small". By
clicking the "Update" button, a forest plot, density curve, and summary
statistics were obtained for the MAP prior as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:fig31} and Figure \ref{fig:fig32}. The parametric distribution
of the MAP prior was approximated by a mixture of three Beta
distributions. The effective sample size is 67.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/toy_forest.png}
\caption{Forest Plot}
\label{fig:fig31}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/toy_map_table.png}
\caption{MAP Prior}
\label{fig:fig32}
\end{figure}

\newpage

# **Robust MAP Prior**

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/maprobo.png}
\end{figure}

To protect against prior-data conflict, MAP priors should be robustified
@schmidli_robust_2014-1. This adds a weakly informative component to the (informative) MAP prior distribution, such that the more the historical data differs from the observed data, the more robust MAP Prior will down-weight/discount the
information from the historical data thus preventing prior data
conflict. The default prior weight on the weakly informative component has been set to 0.2 (20%) discounting factor.

Depending on the expected comparability between the historical data and
the observed data, the user can choose the weight of the weakly
informative robust prior component. The smaller the weakly-informative
prior weight figure, the more confidence the user has in the historical
data and the less discount in the historical data.

The amount of robustification (i.e., the weakly-informative prior weight) can be manipulated using the the slider as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig13}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/robslider.png}
\caption{Robustification}
\label{fig:fig13}
\end{figure}

A graph depicting both the MAP Prior and Robust MAP Prior is the
generated on the right hand side of the page, shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig14}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/robustmap.png}
\caption{Robust MAP Prior}
\label{fig:fig14}
\end{figure}

For incidence proportion analysis, the uninformative mean is set to 50% and thus a Beta(1,1) distribution is chosen as the weakly-informative prior. For exposure-adjusted adverse event rate, a weakly-informative prior mean
(hazard ratio) as in Figure \ref{fig:fig15} is also selected for the
robust MAP prior to be calculated and the mean value is supposed to be chosen by the user. Note that if the SD for the robustified MAP prior is larger than 1, this means that the robustification turns to be informative so that we suggest not to borrow any information.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/robsliderea.png}
\caption{Robust MAP Prior for Exposure-Adjusted Adverse Event}
\label{fig:fig15}
\end{figure}

For the simple example, to protect against prior data conflict, the default weight 20% (i.e., 20% on weakly-informative part and 80% on informative part) was set
as discounting factor. Figure \ref{fig:fig33} depicts both the MAP prior
and robustified MAP prior. By adding the non-informative part, now the
robustified MAP prior is approximated by four Beta distributions. The
former three Beta component were down weighted so that the effective
sample size reduces to 52.

Here note that the mode/peak of the distribution you see in the plot might be different from the mean shown in the table underneath the plot in that both the prior and robustified prior are mixture of multiple densities.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/toy_robust.png}
\caption{Robust MAP Prior}
\label{fig:fig33}
\end{figure}

\newpage

# **New Trial Analysis**

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/nta11.png}
\end{figure}

The new trial analysis portion of the application is mainly used for
exploratory purposes.

To input the results of the observed trial (for the arm for which the (robust) MAP prior was generated), manipulate the slider in
Figure \ref{fig:fig16} which has a separate slider for both the total
number of patients and the number of patients with the adverse events. The example shown is for incidence proportions.

The maximum number of patients that can be entered is 200.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/nta2.png}
\caption{Input for New Trial (using data from the same arm for which the (robust) MAP prior was generated)}
\label{fig:fig16}
\end{figure}

The Robust MAP Prior obtained in Figure \ref{fig:fig14} is then updated
with the observed data from the respective arm (data from the new trial). This provides a
Bayesian Posterior Analysis of the observed data. This could be data
from an actual current trial or a hypothetical trial. The summary of the
Robust MAP Prior, Likelihood and Posterior is generated graphically as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig17}. The generated graph allows the user to
asses for potential prior data conflict.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/nta3.png}
\caption{Trial Data Conflict Assessment}
\label{fig:fig17}
\end{figure}

The Robust MAP Prior describes the historical data.

The Likelihood describes the observed/current data.

The Posterior distribution describes the synthesis of historical prior
and the observed trial data from which decisions can then be made.

For the simple example, after obtaining the robustified MAP prior for a particular arm, we now input concurrent trial
data for the same arm.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/toy_current.png}
\caption{Concurrent Trial Data}
\label{fig:fig34}
\end{figure}

By clicking the "Update" button, the posterior distribution is obtained
by combining the robustified MAP prior and the observed data. The
summary of the robustified MAP prior, likelihood, and posterior is
generated graphically as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig35}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/toy_post.png}
\caption{Posterior Distribution}
\label{fig:fig35}
\end{figure}

\newpage

# **Decision Making**

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/dm1.png}
\end{figure}

The Decision Making tab allows statistical inferences to be made
based on the Likelihood, MAP Prior, Robust MAP Prior and the Posterior
distribution. These options can be obtained by assessing the drop-down
menu in Figure \ref{fig:fig18}. Note that the inference based on the likelihood is with respect to the observed data, in contrast to which based on the prior/posterior are with respect to the underlying parameter.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/dm3.png}
\caption{Statistical Inferences}
\label{fig:fig18}
\end{figure}

Probabilities can be obtained for values exceeding/not-exceeding/between
limits that can be specified using the slider as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:fig19} on the left hand-side of the page.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/dm2.png}
\caption{Making Statistical Inferences}
\label{fig:fig19}
\end{figure}

A graph is then generated on the right hand-side of the page.

Additionally, inferences are made with 90%, 95% and 99% probabilities as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig20}, e.g., from Figure \ref{fig:fig20} there
is a 1% certainty that the proportion of patients with adverse_event is
greater than 30%.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/dm4.png}
\caption{Inferences}
\label{fig:fig20}
\end{figure}

For the simple example, given the posterior, we want to know the probability of percentage of
patients with DILI greater than 3%. By moving the left endpoint of the
slider to 3% and clicking the "Update" button, the cumulative
probability right to 3% under the posterior density is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:fig37}. The conclusion is that we are at least 12% certain that
the proportion of patients with DILI is greater than 3%.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/toy_decision.png}
\caption{Decision Making}
\label{fig:fig36}

# **Download Results**

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/dr1.png}
\end{figure}

Summary tables are produced that contain the posterior probability
analysis for all the adverse events in the uploaded dataset. There are
also tables for the Incidence Proportion and Exposure-adjusted Adverse
Event Rates for all the adverse events in the dataset.

The values that are used in exploring the uploaded dataset has no effect
in generating the summary tables of the analysis as the default settings
are used.

Summary tables are generated for all adverse events in the dataset and
not only those that were explored.

On clicking the show/hide Comparison button in Figure \ref{fig:fig21},
the user selects the treatment and control arms that is to be compared
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig22}. The user can make up to five
different treatment arm comparisons. The slider in Figure
\ref{fig:fig21} can be moved based on the number of comparisons the user
wants to do. On increasing the number of comparisons needed as in Figure
\ref{fig:fig21}, the number of show/hide comparison options also
increases for which the respective treatment and control arms can be
selected as in Figure \ref{fig:fig22}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/dr2.png}

\label{fig:fig23}
\end{figure}

Once the Treatment and Control arms has been selected by the user, click
the Submit button. The user then waits for the simulation/calculation to
be completed. A progress bar Figure \ref{fig:fig24} is displayed on the
bottom-right corner. Depending on the number of Adverse Event Endpoints
and the number of comparisons done, this simulation process can take
some time.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/dr5.png}
\caption{Simulation Progress}
\label{fig:fig24}
\end{figure}

Once the simulation is completed, the chosen comparisons are then
displayed (from Figure \ref{fig:fig25} to Figure \ref{fig:fig26}) on the
right-hand side on the page.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/dr6.png}

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/dr7.png}
\caption{After Completing Simulation}
\label{fig:fig26}
\end{figure}

On completion of the simulation, the results which is presented in a
tabular form which can be downloaded as a .pdf file by clicking the
Download All AE Summary Tables as shown in Figure \ref{fig:fig27}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics{../bsafe_manual_pics_online/dr8.png}

\end{figure}

For each comparison, five different tables are produced:

-   Table 1 lists the different trials that makes up each arm (Treatment
    and Control) of the comparison.

-   Table 2 indicates the number of patients that experienced each
    Adverse Event r, the total number of patients n, and the proportion
    (%) of patients with AE in the population. Posterior summary shows
    the Posterior Distribution mean, median and the 95% credible
    interval.

-   Table 3 estimates the Risk Difference and the Risk Ratio calculated
    from the number of patients with the event r and the total number of
    patient n (Incidence Proportion). Posterior summary shows the
    Posterior Distribution mean, median and 95% credible interval.

-   Table 4 shows the Exposure-Adjusted Adverse Event rate, the rate of
    patients with event per patient year at risk. Naive estimates shows
    the (pooled) number of patients with event r, divided by the
    (pooled) total exposure time. Posterior summary shows the Posterior
    Distribution mean, median and 95% credible interval.

-   Table 5 estimates the Risk Difference and Risk Ratio calculated from
    (pooled) number of patients with event r and (pooled) number of
    patients (Exposure-Adjusted Adverse Event Rate). Posterior summary
    shows the Posterior Distribution mean, median and 95% credible
    interval.
