    Historical controls (HCs) can be used for model parameter estimation at the study design phase, adaptation within a study, or supplementation or replacement of a control arm.

This paper provides a comprehensive roadmap for planning, conducting, analyzing and reporting of studies using HCs, mainly when a randomized clinical trial is not possible. We review recent applications of HC in clinical trials, in which either predominantly a large treatment effect overcame concerns about bias, or the trial targeted a life-threatening disease with no treatment options. In contrast, we address how the evidentiary standard of a trial can be strengthened with optimized study designs and analysis strategies, emphasizing rare and pediatric indications. We highlight the importance of simulation and sensitivity analyses for estimating the range of uncertainties in the estimation of treatment effect when traditional randomization is not possible.

    Determining the sample size of an experiment can be challenging, even more so when incorporating external information via a prior distribution. Such information is increasingly used to reduce the size of the control group in randomized clinical trials. Knowing the amount of prior information, expressed as an equivalent prior
    effective sample size (ESS)
    , clearly facilitates trial designs. Various methods to obtain a prior's
              ESS
              have been proposed recently. They have been justified by the fact that they give the standard
              ESS
              for one‐parameter exponential families. However, despite being based on similar information‐based metrics, they may lead to surprisingly different
              ESS
              for nonconjugate settings, which complicates many designs with prior information. We show that current methods fail a basic predictive consistency criterion, which requires the expected posterior‐predictive
              ESS
              for a sample of size
              N
              to be the sum of the prior
              ESS
              and
              N
              . The
              expected local‐information‐ratio
              ESS
              is introduced and shown to be predictively consistent. It corrects the
              ESS
              of current methods, as shown for normally distributed data with a heavy‐tailed Student‐t prior and exponential data with a generalized Gamma prior. Finally, two applications are discussed: the prior
              ESS
              for the control group derived from historical data and the posterior
              ESS
              for hierarchical subgroup analyses.},

Several Bayesian methods have been proposed for including historical data as prior information in the analysis of the current trial, such as the (modified) power prior, the (robust) meta-analytic-predictive prior, the commensurate prior and methods proposed by Pocock and Murray et al. We compared these methods and illustrated their use in a practical setting, including an assessment of the comparability of the current and the historical data. The motivating data set consists of randomised controlled trials for acute myeloid leukaemia. A simulation study was used to compare the methods in terms of bias, precision, power and type I error rate. Methods that estimate parameters for the between-trial heterogeneity generally offer the best trade-off of power, precision and type I error, with the meta-analytic-predictive prior being the most promising method. The results show that it can be feasible to include historical data in the analysis of clinical trials, if an appropriate method is used to estimate the heterogeneity between trials, and the historical data satisfy criteria for comparability.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT
    Clinical trials rarely, if ever, occur in a vacuum. Generally, large amounts of clinical data are available prior to the start of a study, particularly on the current study's control arm. There is obvious appeal in using (i.e., ‘borrowing’) this information. With historical data providing information on the control arm, more trial resources can be devoted to the novel treatment while retaining accurate estimates of the current control arm parameters. This can result in more accurate point estimates, increased power, and reduced type I error in clinical trials, provided the historical information is sufficiently similar to the current control data. If this assumption of similarity is not satisfied, however, one can acquire increased mean square error of point estimates due to bias and either reduced power or increased type I error depending on the direction of the bias. In this manuscript, we review several methods for historical borrowing, illustrating how key parameters in each method affect borrowing behavior, and then, we compare these methods on the basis of mean square error, power and type I error. We emphasize two main themes. First, we discuss the idea of ‘dynamic’ (versus ‘static’) borrowing. Second, we emphasize the decision process involved in determining whether or not to include historical borrowing in terms of the perceived likelihood that the current control arm is sufficiently similar to the historical data. Our goal is to provide a clear review of the key issues involved in historical borrowing and provide a comparison of several methods useful for practitioners.

	abstract = {We propose a general class of prior distributions for arbitrary regression models. We discuss parametric and semiparametric models. The prior specification for the regression coefficients focuses on observable quantities in that the elicitation is based on the availability of historical data D$_{\textrm{0}}$ and a scalar quantity a$_{\textrm{0}}$ quantifying the uncertainty in D$_{\textrm{0}}$. Then D$_{\textrm{0}}$ and a$_{\textrm{0}}$ are used to specify a prior for the regression coefficients in a semiautomatic fashion. The most natural specification of D$_{\textrm{0}}$ arises when the raw data from a similar previous study are available. The availability of historical data is quite common in clinical trials, carcinogenicity studies, and environmental studies, where large data bases are available from similar previous studies. Although the methodology we present here is quite general, we will focus only on using historical data from similar previous studies to construct the prior distributions. The prior distributions are based on the idea of raising the likelihood function of the historical data to the power a$_{\textrm{0}}$, where ≤ a$_{\textrm{0}}$ ≤ 1. We call such prior distributions power prior distributions. We examine the power prior for four commonly used classes of regression models. These include generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models, semiparametric proportional hazards models, and cure rate models for survival data. For these classes of models, we discuss the construction of the power prior, prior elicitation issues, propriety conditions, model selection, and several other properties. For each class of models, we present real data sets to demonstrate the proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {Background Historical information is always relevant when designing clinical trials, but it might also be incorporated in the analysis. It seems appropriate to exploit past information on comparable control groups.
            Purpose Phase IV and proof-of-concept trials are used to discuss aspects of summarizing historical control data as prior information in a new trial. The importance of a fair assessment of the similarity of control parameters is emphasized.
            Methods The methodology is meta-analytic-predictive. Heterogeneity of control parameters is expressed via the between-trial variation, which is the key parameter determining the prior effective sample size and its upper bound (prior maximum sample size).
            Results For a Phase IV trial (930 control patients in 11 historical trials) between-trial heterogeneity was fairly small, resulting in a prior effective sample size of approximately 90 patients. For a proof-of-concept trial (363 patients in four historical trials) heterogeneity was moderate to substantial, resulting in a prior effective sample size of approximately 20. For another proof-of-concept trial (14 patients in one historical trial), assuming substantial heterogeneity implied a prior effective sample size of 7. The prior effective sample size can only be large if the amount of historical data is large and between-trial heterogeneity is small. The prior effective sample size is bounded by the prior maximum sample size (ratio of within- to between-trial variance), irrespective of the amount of historical data.
            Limitations The meta-analytic-predictive approach assumes exchangeability of control parameters across trials. Due to the difficulty to quantify between-trial variability, sensitivity of conclusions regarding assumptions and type of inference should be assessed.
            Conclusions The use of historical control information is a valuable option and may lead to more efficient clinical trials. The proposed approach is attractive for nonconfirmatory trials, but under certain circumstances extensions to the confirmatory setting could be envisaged as well.

The hierarchical MAP model is evaluated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The MCMC samples representing the MAP prior are approximated with parametric mixture densities which are obtained with the expectation maximization algorithm. The parametric mixture density representation facilitates easy communication of the MAP prior and enables fast and accurate analytical procedures to evaluate properties of trial designs with informative MAP priors.
